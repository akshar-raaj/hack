H and M: 1/6
H and not M: 1/2 * 2/3: 1/3
not H and M: 1/6
not H and not M: 1/3

Probability of getting H or M: 2/3
H gets chosen no matter what gets chosen in second independent event: 1/2
M gets chosen no matter what got chosen in first independent event: 1/3
H associated with M is already counted, so remove it: 5/6 - 1/6: 2/3
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

P(H or M) = P(H and not M) + P (H and M) + P(not H and M)
		  = 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/6
		  = 2/3

There are two days in a year. Let's say them Christmas and Halloween. Probability of any person being born on Christmas is 1/2.
We are three people in the room.
P(A born on Christmas) = 1/2
P(B born on Christmas) = 1/2
P(C born on Christmas) = 1/2
A on Christmas, B on Christmas, C on Christmas
A on Christmas, B on Christmas, C not on Christmas
A on Christmas, B not on Christmas, C on Christmas
A on Christmas, B not on Christmas, C on Christmas
A not on Christmas, B on Christmas, C on Christmas
A not on Christmas, B on Christmas, C not on Christmas
A not on Christmas, B not on Christmas, C on Christmas
A not on Christmas, B not on Christmas, C on Christmas
